Defaults to `process.cwd()`\n\n* `ignoreFiles` Filenames to treat as ignore files.  The default is\n  `['.ignore']`.  (This is where you'd put `.gitignore` or\n  `.npmignore` or whatever.)  If multiple ignore files are in a\n  directory, then rules from each are applied in the order that the\n  files are listed.\n\n* `includeEmpty` Set to `true` to include empty directories, assuming\n  they are not excluded by any of the ignore rules.  If not set, then\n  this follows the standard `git` behavior of not including\n  directories that are empty.\n\n    Note: this will cause an empty directory to be included if it\n    would contain an included entry, even if it would have otherwise\n    been excluded itself.\n\n    For example, given the rules `*` (ignore everything) and `!/a/b/c`\n    (re-include the entry at `/a/b/c`), the directory `/a/b` will be\n    included if it is empty.\n\n* `follow`  Set to `true` to treat symbolically linked directories as\n  directories, recursing into them.  There is no handling for nested\n  symlinks, so `ELOOP` errors can occur in some cases when using this\n  option.  Defaults to `false`.\n",
