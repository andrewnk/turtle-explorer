Similar to `style-loader`, you can chain it after `css-loader` to dynamically inject CSS into the document as style tags. However, since this is included as a dependency and used by default in `vue-loader`, in most cases you don't need to configure this loader yourself.\n\n## Options\n\n- **manualInject** (3.1.0+):\n\n  Type: `boolean`. When importing the style from a non-vue-file, by default the style is injected as a side effect of the import. When `manualInject` is true, the imported style object exposes a `__inject__` method, which can then be called manually at appropriate timing. If called on the server, the method expects one argument which is the `ssrContext` to attach styles to.\n\n  ``` js\n  import styles from 'styles.scss'\n\n  export default {\n    beforeCreate() { // or create a mixin for this purpose\n      if(styles.__inject__) {\n        styles.__inject__(this.$ssrContext)\n      }\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      return <div class={styles.heading}>Hello World</div>\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Note this behavior is enabled automatically when `vue-style-loader` is used on styles imported within a `*.vue` file. The option is only exposed for advanced usage.\n\n- **ssrId** (3.1.0+):\n\n  Type: `boolean`. Add `data-vue-ssr-id` attribute to injected `<style>` tags even when not in Node.js. This can be used with pre-rendering (instead of SSR) to avoid duplicate style injection on hydration.\n\n## Differences from `style-loader`\n\n### Server-Side Rendering Support\n\nWhen bundling with `target: 'node'`, the styles in all rendered components are collected and exposed on the Vue render context object as `context.styles`, which you can simply inline into your markup's `<head>`. If you are building a Vue SSR app, you probably should use this loader for CSS imported from JavaScript files too.\n\n### Misc\n\n- Does not support url mode and reference counting mode. Also removed `singleton` and `insertAt` query options. It always automatically pick the style insertion mechanism that makes most sense. If you need these capabilities you should probably use the original `style-loader` instead.\n\n- Fixed the issue that root-relative URLs are interpreted against chrome:// urls and make source map URLs work for injected `<style>` tags in Chrome.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
