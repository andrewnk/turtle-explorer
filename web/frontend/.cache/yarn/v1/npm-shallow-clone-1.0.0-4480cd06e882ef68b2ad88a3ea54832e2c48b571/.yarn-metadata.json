So any objects in the array will still not be cloned (e.g. they will be the same object as in the orginal array).\n\n```js\nvar arr = [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\nvar foo = clone(arr);\n// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\n\n// array is cloned\nassert.equal(actual === expected, false);\n\n// array elements are not\nassert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true\n```\n\n## returns primitives as-is\n\n```js\nclone(0)\n//=> 0\n\nclone('foo')\n//=> 'foo'\n```\n\n## shallow clone a regex\n\n```js\nclone(/foo/g)\n//=> /foo/g\n```\n\n## shallow clone an object\n\n```js\nclone({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })\n//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n```\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [assign-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep) | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep \"Deeply assign the enumerable properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target (first) object.\")\n* [clone-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-deep): Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep \"Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.\")\n* [extend-shallow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow \"Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util.\")\n* [is-plain-object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-plain-object): Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object \"Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor.\")\n* [isobject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isobject): Returns true if the value is an object and not an array or null. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/isobject \"Returns true if the value is an object and not an array or null.\")\n* [kind-of](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kind-of): Get the native type of a value. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/kind-of \"Get the native type of a value.\")\n* [mixin-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mixin-deep): Deeply mix the properties of objects into the first object.
