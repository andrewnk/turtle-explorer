    "readme": "# Javascript implementation of xxHash\n\n## Synopsis\n\nxxHash is a very fast hashing algorithm (see the details [here](https://code.google.com/p/xxhash/)). xxhashjs is a Javascript implementation of it, written in 100% Javascript. Although not as fast as the C version, it does perform pretty well given the current Javascript limitations in handling unsigned 32 bits integers.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nIn nodejs:\n\n    npm install xxhashjs\n\nIn the browser, include the following, and access the constructor with _XXH_:\n\n```javascript\n<script src=\"/your/path/to/xxhash.js\"></script>\n```\n\n\n## Examples\n\n* In one step:\n```javascript\nvar h = XXH.h32( 'abcd', 0xABCD ).toString(16)\t// seed = 0xABCD\n```\n> 0xCDA8FAE4\n\n* In several steps (useful in conjunction of NodeJS streams):\n```javascript\nvar H = XXH.h32( 0xABCD )\t// seed = 0xABCD\nvar h = H.update( 'abcd' ).digest().toString(16)\n```\n> 0xCDA8FAE4\n\n* More examples in the examples directory:\n\t* Compute xxHash from a file data\n\t* Use xxHashjs in the browser\n\n\n## Usage\n\n* XXH makes 2 functions available for 32 bits XXH and 64 bits XXH respectively, with the same signature:\n\n\t* XXH.h32\n\t* XXH.h64\n\n* In one step:\n`XXH.h32(<data>, <seed>)`\nThe data can either be a string, an ArrayBuffer or a NodeJS Buffer object.\nThe seed can either be a number or a UINT32 object.\n\n* In several steps:\n\t* instantiate a new XXH object H:\n`XXH.h32(<seed>)` or `XXH.h32()`\nThe seed can be set later on with the `init` method\n\n\t* add data to the hash calculation:\n`H.update(<data>)`\n\n\t* finish the calculations:\n`H.digest()`\n\nThe object returned can be converted to a string with `toString(<radix>)` or a number `toNumber()`.\nOnce `digest()` has been called, the object can be reused. The same seed will be used or it can be changed with `init(<seed>)`.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n* `XXH.h32()`\n\t* `.init(<seed>)`\n\tInitialize the XXH object with the given seed. The seed can either be a number or a UINT32 object.\n\t* `.update(<data>)`\n\tAdd data for hashing. The data can either be a string, an ArrayBuffer or a NodeJS Buffer object.\n\n* `digest()` (_UINT32_)\n\tFinalize the hash calculations and returns an UINT32 object. The hash value can be retrieved with toString(<radix>).\n\n* `XXH.h64()`\n\t* `.init(<seed>)`\n\tInitialize the XXH object with the given seed. The seed can either be a number or a UINT64 object.\n\t* `.update(<data>)`\n\tAdd data for hashing. The data can either be a string, an ArrayBuffer or a NodeJS Buffer object.\n\t* `.digest()` (_UINT64_)\n\tFinalize the hash calculations and returns an UINT64 object. The hash value can be retrieved with toString(<radix>).\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT",
