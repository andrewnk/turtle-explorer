If a `package.json` file is found, and it has a `files` list,\n   then ignore everything that isn't in `files`.  Always include the\n   readme, license, notice, changes, changelog, and history files, if\n   they exist, and the package.json file itself.\n2. If there's no `package.json` file (or it has no `files` list), and\n   there is a `.npmignore` file, then ignore all the files in the\n   `.npmignore` file.\n3. If there's no `package.json` with a `files` list, and there's no\n   `.npmignore` file, but there is a `.gitignore` file, then ignore\n   all the files in the `.gitignore` file.\n4. Everything in the root `node_modules` is ignored, unless it's a\n   bundled dependency.  If it IS a bundled dependency, and it's a\n   symbolic link, then the target of the link is included, not the\n   symlink itself.\n4. Unless they're explicitly included (by being in a `files` list, or\n   a `!negated` rule in a relevant `.npmignore` or `.gitignore`),\n   always ignore certain common cruft files:\n\n    1. .npmignore and .gitignore files (their effect is in the package\n       already, there's no need to include them in the package)\n    2. editor junk like `.*.swp`, `._*` and `.*.orig` files\n    3. `.npmrc` files (these may contain private configs)\n    4. The `node_modules/.bin` folder\n    5. Waf and gyp cruft like `/build/config.gypi` and `.lock-wscript`\n    6. Darwin's `.DS_Store` files because wtf are those even\n    7. `npm-debug.log` files at the root of a project\n\n    You can explicitly re-include any of these with a `files` list in\n    `package.json` or a negated ignore file rule.\n\n## API\n\nSame API as [ignore-walk](http://npm.im/ignore-walk), just hard-coded\nfile list and rule sets.\n\nThe `Walker` and `WalkerSync` classes take a `bundled` argument, which\nis a list of package names to include from node_modules.  When calling\nthe top-level `packlist()` and `packlist.sync()` functions, this\nmodule calls into `npm-bundled` directly.\n",
